Well\ntested, with full code coverage, in both the browser and Node.js environments.\n\nDepends on Underscore, Backbone, and jQuery.  You can swap out the dependencies\nwith a custom configuration.\n\n## Documentation ##\n\nhttp://layoutmanager.org/\n\n## Migrating from 0.7 ##\n\nhttp://layoutmanager.org/From-0.7-to-0.8\n\n## Release notes ##\n\n* Upgraded Cheerio dependency to v0.11.0.\n* Many optimizations and fixes to `getViews` by @jugglinmike.  This includes\n  fixes for issues like `removeView` on an invalid selector.\n* `cleanup` is now called with the proper context.\n* @SBoudrias added `.gitattributes` and `.editconfig` to ease development\n  stress for our contributors.\n* Fix provided by @adamdicarlo to fix a bug where re-rendering with\n  empty rendered contents would not replace the existing content.\n\n[Full Release\nLog](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/blob/master/changelog.md)\n\n## Contributing ##\n\nPlease read and follow the [contribution\nguide](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/blob/master/contributing.md)\nbefore contributing.\n\n**Running the unit tests in the browser**\n\nOpen `test/index.html` in your favorite browser to ensure LayoutManager works\nas expected.\n\n**Running the unit tests headless**\n\nInstall [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Grunt.js 0.4](http://gruntjs.com), and\nrun `npm install` inside the project directory.\n\nMake sure you've installed `grunt-cli` globally with:\n\n``` bash\n[sudo] npm install grunt-cli -g\n```\n\nRun `grunt` inside a terminal in the project directory to run the tests in both\na headless browser and Node.js environment.\n\n## Donate ##\n\nI do my very best to ensure top quality and continued progress with\nLayoutManager.
