Unfortunately,\nSauce Labs has no support to start browsers in private mode, which would\nbe necessary, as `localStorage` behaves different if in private mode\nin Safari, probably in other browsers as well.\n\nIf anynone has an idea to for that, ping me at\nhttps://github.com/gr2m/has-localstorage/issues/1\n\n\n# Acknowledgement\n\n`hasLocalStorage()` has been inspired by this [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino-project.org/) commit:\nhttps://github.com/cappuccino/cappuccino/commit/063b05d9643c35b303568a28809e4eb3224f71ec\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
