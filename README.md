## Contributing to SF In Progress

### About the Project
SF In Progress is an open source project with the goal of creating more awareness and educating SF citizens on new housing development issues the city is facing. Because this is a volunteer based project we would like to keep the tech stack as short and simple as possible, we are currently using the following technologies:

* Plain HTML + CSS
* Node.js for server and dependency management
* React.js to render the Map Page of San Francisco Properties
* MongoDB for data storage
* MapBox API for map tile and leaflet API.

Any additions to the tech stack should first be discussed and agreed upon by project contributors as a group to keep it as newcomer friendly as possible.
