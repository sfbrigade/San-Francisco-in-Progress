It gives us the core constructs that are needed to build\nsmall apps, organize jQuery DOM events, or create single page apps that\nsupport mobile devices and large scale enterprise needs. But Backbone is\nnot a complete framework. It's a set of building blocks. It leaves\nmuch of the application design, architecture and scalability to the\ndeveloper, including memory management, view management, and more.\n\nMarionette brings an application architecture to Backbone, along with\nbuilt in view management and memory management. It's designed to be a\nlightweight and flexible library of tools that sits on top of Backbone,\nproviding the framework for building a scalable application.\n\nLike Backbone itself, you're not required to use all of Marionette just\nbecause you want to use some of it. You can pick and choose which features\nyou want to use. This allows you to work with other Backbone\nframeworks and plugins easily. It also means that you are not required\nto engage in an all-or-nothing migration to begin using Marionette.\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n* Scalable: applications are built in modules, and with event-driven architecture\n* Sensible defaults: Underscore templates are used for view rendering\n* Easily modifiable: make it work with your application's specific needs\n* Reduce boilerplate for views, with specialized view types\n* Build on a modular architecture with an `Application` and modules that attach to it\n* Compose your application's visuals at runtime, with the `Region` and `Layout` objects\n* Nested views and layouts within visual regions\n* Built-in memory management and zombie-killing in views, regions and layouts\n* Event-driven architecture with `Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator`\n* Flexible, \"as-needed\" architecture allowing you to pick and choose what you need\n* And much, much more\n\n## Source Code and Downloads\n\nYou can download the latest builds directly from the \"lib\" folder above.\nFor more information about the files in this folder, or to obtain an archive\ncontaining all Marionette dependencies (including Underscore, Backbone, etc.),\nplease visit [the downloads section on the website](http://marionettejs.com#download).\n\n#### [MarionetteJS.com](http://marionettejs.com#download)\n\n### Available Packages\n\nMarionette is unofficially available from various package\nmanagement systems, such as RubyGems, Node Package Manager,\nNuget, etc. These packages are maintained by the community\nand are not part of the core Backbone.Marionette code.\n\n##### [Available Packages](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/wiki/Available-packages)\n\n## Release Notes And Upgrade Guide\n\n**Changelog**: For change logs and release notes, see the\n[changelog](changelog.md) file.\n\n**Upgrade Guide**: Be sure to read [the upgrade guide](upgradeGuide.md)\nfor information on upgrading to the latest version of Marionette.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe primary documentation is split up into multiple files, due to the size\nof the overall documentation. You can find these files in the\n[/docs](docs) folder, or use the links below to get straight to the\ndocumentation for each piece of Marionette.\n\n### Annotated Source Code\n\nIn addition to this readme, I've commented the source code quite\nheavily and run it through Docco as part of my build process.\nThis produces a nicely formatted, annotated source code as a documentation\nfile.\n\nYou can read the annotations for all the details of how Marionette works, and advice on which methods to override.\n\n##### [View the annotated source code](http://marionettejs.com/docs/backbone.marionette.html)\n\n### Marionette Configuration\n\nMarionette provides a few globally configurable settings, such as which\nDOM library to use (jQuery by default). You can find out more about which\nsettings will change Marionette in the [configuration\ndocumentation](docs/marionette.configuration.md).\n\n### Marionette's Pieces\n\nThese are the strings that you can pull to make your puppet dance.\nIf you're looking for an introduction and/or\nexamples on how to get started, please visit [the Wiki](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/wiki).\n\n**Views**\n\n* [**Marionette.ItemView**](docs/marionette.itemview.md): A view that renders a single item\n* [**Marionette.CollectionView**](docs/marionette.collectionview.md): A view that iterates over a collection, and renders individual `ItemView` instances for each model\n* [**Marionette.CompositeView**](docs/marionette.compositeview.md): A collection view and item view, for rendering leaf-branch/composite model hierarchies\n* [**Marionette.Layout**](docs/marionette.layout.md): A view that renders a layout and creates region managers to manage areas within it\n* [**Marionette.View**](docs/marionette.view.md): The base View type that other Marionette views extend from (not intended to be used directly)\n\n**Behaviors**\n\n* [**Marionette.Behavior**](docs/marionette.behavior.md): an encapsulated `View` interaction layer that can be mixed into any `view`, helping to DRY up your view code.\n* [**Marionette.Behaviors**](docs/marionette.behaviors.md): A helper class to glue your behaviors to your views.\n\n**View Management**\n\n* [**Marionette.Region**](docs/marionette.region.md): Manage visual regions of your application, including display and removal of content\n* [**Marionette.RegionManager**](docs/marionette.regionmanager.md): Manage a group of related Regions\n* [**Marionette.Renderer**](docs/marionette.renderer.md): Render templates with or without data, in a consistent and common manner\n* [**Marionette.TemplateCache**](docs/marionette.templatecache.md): Cache templates that are stored in `<script>` blocks, for faster subsequent access\n* [&rarr;] [**Backbone.BabySitter**](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter): Manage child views for your Backbone.View (and other parents)\n\n**Application Infrastructure**\n\n* [**Marionette.Application**](docs/marionette.application.md): An application object that starts your app via initializers, and more\n* [**Marionette.Module**](docs/marionette.application.module.md): Create modules and sub-modules within the application\n* [**Marionette.Controller**](docs/marionette.controller.md): A general purpose object for controlling modules, routers, view, and implementing a mediator pattern\n* [**Marionette.Commands**](docs/marionette.application.md#commands): An extension of Backbone.Wreqr.Commands, a simple command execution framework\n* [**Marionette.RequestResponse**](docs/marionette.application.md#request-response): An extension of Backbone.Wreqr.RequestResponse, a simple request/response framework\n* [&rarr;] [**Backbone.Wreqr.EventAggregator**](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr): An event aggregator, to facilitate pub/sub and event architecture.

If you're looking for\ncommunity-driven information, examples that go beyond the\ndry technical documentation, or want to contribute your own\nideas and examples to the community, please see the wiki page.\n\n##### [View The Marionette Wiki](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/wiki)\n\n## Compatibility and Requirements\n\nMarionetteJS currently works with the following libraries:\n\n* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) v1.8+\n* [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) v1.4.4 - 1.6.0\n* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) v1.0.0 - 1.1.2 are preferred. v0.9.9 and v0.9.10 should work still\n* [Backbone.Wreqr](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.wreqr)\n* [Backbone.BabySitter](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.babysitter)\n\nMarionette has not been tested against any other versions of these\nlibraries. You may or may not have success if you use a version other\nthan what it listed here.\n\nWhile support for Zepto and EnderJS has been added, it is not officially\ntested against these libraries at this time.\n\n### Deferred/Promise Objects\n\nMarionette makes use of jQuery's [Deferred](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/)\nobjects and, as such, will need supported methods in replacement libraries.\nZepto users can use @Mumakil's [Standalone-Deferred](https://github.com/Mumakil/Standalone-Deferred)\nor @sudhirj's [simply-deferred](https://github.com/sudhirj/simply-deferred).\nEnderJS users, please let us know of how you solve any compatibility issues.\n\nMarionette no longer relies on [Backbone.EventBinder](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.eventbinder).\nBackbone.Events, as of v0.9.9, supersedes this library with its\n`listenTo` and `stopListening` methods. See [the upgrade guide](upgradeGuide.md)\nfor more information.\n\n## Donations\n\nMarionette needs your support, but not everyone can offer assistance\nwith code, bug submissions, and answering questions. If you're using\nMarionette and you're finding that it is saving you as much time and\neffort as I believe it does, then please consider financial support\nfor the project.\n\n**Please see the footer of [MarionetteJS.com](http://marionettejs.com)\nfor links to donate.**\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Marionette's source code, please read\nthe [guidelines for pull requests and contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md).\nFollowing these guidelines will help make your contributions easier to\nbring into the next release.\n\n## Help is Just a Click Away\n\n### #Marionette on FreeNode.net IRC\n\nJoin the `#marionette` channel on [FreeNode.net](http://freenode.net) to ask questions and get help.\n\n### [Google Group Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/backbone-marionette)\n\nGet announcements for new releases, share your projects and ideas that are\nusing Marionette, and join in open-ended discussion that does not fit in\nto the Github issues list or StackOverflow Q&A.\n\n**For help with syntax, specific questions on how to implement a feature\nusing Marionette, and other Q&A items, use StackOverflow.**\n\n### [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backbone.marionette)\n\nAsk questions about using Marionette in specific scenarios, with\nspecific features. For example, help with syntax, understanding how a feature works and\nhow to override that feature to do what you need or how to organize the\ndifferent view types to work best with your applications needs.\n\nQuestions on StackOverflow often turn in to blog posts and wiki entries.\n\n### [Github Issues](//github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/issues)\n\nReport issues with Marionette, submit pull requests to fix problems, or to\ncreate summarized and documented feature requests (preferably with pull\nrequests that implement the feature).\n\n**Please don't ask questions or seek help in the issues list.** There are\nother, better channels for seeking assistance, like StackOverflow and the\nGoogle Groups mailing list.\n\n### [DerickBailey.LosTechies.com](http://derickbailey.lostechies.com)\n\nLastly, I blog about Marionette on a regular basis, at my\nLosTechies.com blog.\n\n## Legal Mumbo Jumbo (MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2014 Derick Bailey; Muted Solutions, LLC\n\nDistributed under [MIT license](http://mutedsolutions.mit-license.org/).\n\n[![bitdeli analytics](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n",
